SSHRPG: No Longer Maintained
============================

An ASCII/text-based RPG engine for Unix systems in the vein of nethack.

SSHRPG is no longer maintained. SSHRPG was last updated Oct 20, 2013.

This was all an experiment, it's currently in a broken state and filled with code I'm not exactly proud of, and I'm not sure if I want to bother to fix it. Who knows what the future holds, though, right?
